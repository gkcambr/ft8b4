MAKE FT8B4

Download the ft8b zip file from github and extract the files to a directory named ft8b4.
To make ft8b4 you will need two libraries, ncurses and sqlite3. On a debian host you can install these libraries using the following commands:

$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
$ sudp apt install sqlite3

Make ft8b4 using the command:

$ make -f ft8b4.mk all

The executable file ft8b4 should be saved in the ft8b4/dist directory. Copy the file to a location on your PATH, such as /usr/local/bin. Make sure it has execute privileges.

CONFIGURE FT8B4

Copy the configuration file, ft8b4.cfg to a location such as $(HOME)/.klog .
Edit ft8b4.cfg by updating the following fields:

xmitToPort - default is 3333. This port number must agree with the KLOG UPD Port. You can check the port using the Klog menu settings->WSJT-X.

proxyRecvPort - default is 2237. Unless this port is already in use, you can use the default. This port number must agree with the WSJT-X reporting port number. Check the WSJT-X port number using the menu sequence File->Settings->Reporting. Look for the UDP Server port number. Make sure the Accept UDP requests and Notify on accepted UDP request boxes are checked.

sqlite3Db - enter the full path name of where the KLOG database is stored. Normally this will be in $(HOME)/.klog/logbook.dat .

skipDays - this parameter determines when a previous QSO is considered 'recent'. Recent QSOs are highlighted in red on the ft8b4 terminal. Older QSOs are in gray.

msgTTL - this is the length of time a CQ request will be displayed on the ft8b4 terminal. Once it exceeds that time it will be removed.

logFile - if you uncomment this line ft8b4 will create logfiles when you run it. A new log file will be created for each day it is run, so unless you have problems with the application I recommend you leave the line commented out. The log files are not automatically deleted.

RUN ft8b4

To run ft8b4 use the command:

$ ft8b4 ft8b4.cfg

I use a menu item which invokes the command:

$ /usr/loca/bin/ft8b4 /home/keithc/.klog/ft8b4

You can resize the ft8b4 terminal window and the display will refresh when a new message is received. The clr-ft8b4 button does just that; it clears the window.
The hide-dupes button eliminates duplicate CQs in the terminal window.
